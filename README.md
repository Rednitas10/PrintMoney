This repository aims to experiment with building an automated trading bot for options. Below is a suggested task list for training a model. This is **not** financial advice and profitability is not guaranteed. Proceed at your own risk and consult a professional financial advisor if needed.

## Tasks

1. **Collect data**: Gather historical option prices, underlying asset data, and relevant market indicators from reliable data vendors. The `collect_data.py` script supports a `--sample-dir` option for loading CSV files when network access is unavailable.
2. **Clean and preprocess**: Handle missing values, adjust for corporate actions (splits, dividends), and align timestamps across data sources. The `preprocess_data.py` script generates cleaned CSV files with basic features like moving averages.
3. **Feature engineering**: Create additional features such as implied volatility, Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega), moving averages, and other technical indicators. The `feature_engineering.py` script illustrates a simple approach for adding RSI, volatility, and option time to expiration.
4. **Model selection**: Test a variety of algorithms (e.g., tree-based models, neural networks, reinforcement learning) to forecast option price movements or risk metrics.
5. **Backtesting**: Evaluate the model on historical data with realistic transaction costs and slippage to assess performance and drawdowns.
6. **Risk management**: Define position sizing rules and risk limits (e.g., maximum exposure per trade, stop-loss thresholds).
7. **Paper trading**: Run the strategy in a simulated environment to verify results before committing real capital.
8. **Deployment**: Automate order execution through a broker API while monitoring latency and system reliability.
9. **Monitoring and iteration**: Continuously track live performance, retrain the model with new data, and refine features or parameters as needed.
